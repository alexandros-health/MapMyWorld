Hi,
i have tried to upload the zip folder with the full projects at least 20 times but always failed due to the folder exceeding udacity limit of 500Mb for the UNCOMPRESSED folder. 
My COMPRESSED zip folder was 400Mb... anyway... i have tried multiple times... weired that the first time i got to upload it successfully.. 
i have also tried to upload it on github but it gave me error as well because rtabmap.db exceeds files limit.
So, i'm sharing with you here the wetransfer link to download the MapMyWorld.zip folder for the review :D 
Hereit is: https://we.tl/t-5TFVa1K9zC
